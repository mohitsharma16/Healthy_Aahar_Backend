1st we need a endpoint for entering the meals acording to lunch breakfast and dinner for our 
recipies okay( we actually have this endpoint it is called log a  meal .)
2nd we need a endpoint for getting the list of recipies like previous melas or meals history okay.
3rd we need to update the current endpoint for recipe recommendation because for now 
on every call it is giving recipies it should give new recipies after every 24 hours.
4th we need an endpoint for getting the weekly reports of the user.
5th we need an endoint for the feedback of the user about the recipes suggested.
6th we also need to tag the recipies for breakfast, lunch , dinner or we can keep meal 1 , meal 2,
meal 3 also.
